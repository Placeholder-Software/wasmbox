import * as links from "@site/src/components/links.js"

This is the first update of Wasmbox. Wasmbox is very new, so it is likely you will encounter bugs, awkward APIs or missing features. Please direct feedback to <links.Discord /> or the <links.IssueTracker />.

### What Happened to Version `2.0.0` -> `7.0.0`?

The [previous version](./v1.0.0.md) of Wasmbox was `1.0.0` and this is version `8.0.0`. This is because we are adopting the same [version/release scheme as Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html). Each month Wasmtime releases a new major version, Wasmbox will then be updated to use that version and will use the same major version number.
