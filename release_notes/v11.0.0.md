This version of Wasmbox upgrades to `Wasmtime v11.0.0`.

### Zip File Mounting.

This version of Wasmbox introduces the ability to mount a zip archive as a read-only filesystem.

<!--truncate-->

Calling the new `MapReadonlyZipArchiveDirectory` method with the path to a zip archive will mount that entire zip archive as a read-only directory. This can be useful to distribute static content with your application as a single zip archive, which can then be easily mounted as read by wasm code.

:::tip

Zip Archives are **read only** and must not be modified while mounted.

### Feedback

Wasmbox is very new, so it is likely you will encounter bugs, awkward APIs or missing features. Please direct feedback to <links.Discord /> or the <links.IssueTracker />.
