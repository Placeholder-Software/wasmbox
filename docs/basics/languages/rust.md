[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is one of the best languages to use to compile to WASM. With full support for WASM & WASI easy to use, just by specifying a compiler flag. Much of the ["crates"](https://crates.io/) ecosystem can be compiled for WASM.

```rust
fn main()
{
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

## Advantages
 - Very fast execution.
 - Easy to compile to WebAssembly.
 - Excellent development tools.
 - Large package ecosystem, compatible with WASM.

## Drawbacks
 - Slow compile time.
 - Complex syntax.
