C# is a language you will know well if you're using Unity!

```csharp
using System;
					
public class Program
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
	}
}
```

## Advantages
 - Huge ecosystem is existing code
 - Same language as Unity
 - Great performance

## Drawbacks
 - Not all libraries can be compiled for WASM
 - Large `.wasm` files

## Resources
 - [Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
 - [dotnet WASI SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-wasi-sdk)
