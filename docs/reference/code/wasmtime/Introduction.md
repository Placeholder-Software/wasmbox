[Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) is a fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly built by the [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/). WasmBox uses the Wasmtime engine to compile and execute WASM. This is exposed through the [wasmtime-dotnet](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet) library.
