This scene demonstrates the most basic usage of <b>Wasmbox</b>.

The `Demo Object` has a `BasicMonoBehaviourDemoScript` attached. This uses the `SimpleWasmMonoBehaviour` to load a WASM file into memory. Once the file is loaded it calls a function which doubles a number, the output is shown at the bottom of the screen.

1. Open `AWatFile.wat` in a text editor, this is raw WebAssembly Text (WAT).

2. Inspect the `Demo Object`.
   a. `AWatFile.wat` has been dropped into the `Wasm Asset` property.
   b. `Engine Config` sets how the asset is compiled and run, this can usually be left at the default settings.

3. Open `BasicMonoBehaviourDemoScript.cs`.
   a. `SimpleWasmMonoBehaviour<AWatFile>` is used instead of `MonoBehaviour`.
   b. `AWatFile` is the name of the autogenerated wrapper code (same name as the file by default).
