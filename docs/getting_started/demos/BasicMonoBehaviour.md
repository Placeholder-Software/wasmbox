This scene demonstrates the most basic usage of <b>Wasmbox</b>. It is located in `Assets\Plugins\PlaceholderSoftware\Wasmbox\Demos`.

The `Demo Object` has a `BasicMonoBehaviourDemoScript` attached. This uses the [`SimpleWasmMonoBehaviour`](./../../reference/code/simplewasmmonobehaviour.md) to load a WASM file into memory. Once the file is loaded it calls a function which doubles a number, the output is shown at the bottom of the screen.

1. Open `AWatFile.wat` in a text editor, this is raw WebAssembly Text (WAT).
2. Inspect the `Demo Object`.
   - `AWatFile.wat` has been dropped into the `Wasm Asset` property.
   - [`Engine Config`](./../../reference/code/engineconfig.md) sets how the asset is compiled and run, this can usually be left at the default settings.
3. Open `BasicMonoBehaviourDemoScript.cs`.
   - `SimpleWasmMonoBehaviour<AWatFile>` is used instead of `MonoBehaviour`.
   - `AWatFile` is the name of the autogenerated wrapper code (same name as the file by default).
