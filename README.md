# Wasmbox

Wasmbox is an easy to use [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) runtime for Unity. WebAssembly (WASM) makes it possible to execute compiled code (e.g. C, C++ or Rust) in a safe and secure sandbox - providing high **performance**, **safe execution** of potentially untrusted code, cross platform **portability** and **deterministic** execution.
